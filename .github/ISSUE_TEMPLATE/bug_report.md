### ⏯ Playground Link

<!--
  A link to a ast-grep Playground "Share" link which shows this behavior.
  This should have the same code as the code snippet below, and use whichever settings are relevant to your report.
  As a last resort, you can link to a repo, but these will be slower for us to investigate.
